# Computer_Graphics_Miniproject

Problem Statement:
In this project, we created a Graphics animation to demonstrate FIFO Page Replacement Algorithm. This is the simplest page replacement algorithm. In this algorithm, the operating system keeps track of all pages in the memory in a queue, the oldest page is in the front of the queue. When a page needs to be replaced page in the front of the queue is selected for removal.
